* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

Start by splitting the task into smaller subtasks, in script.js file, first writing pseudocode for each subtask and then adding the corresponding code to it.

  - prevent default in order to retain the data input from user

In html file, I've added the required link tags to my head element and the script tags right before the closing.
